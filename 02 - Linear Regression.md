# Prerequisites
- m : number of training samples
- x : input variable, features variable
- y : output variable, target variable
- (x, y) : an individual sample
- $(x^{(i)} , y^{(j)})$ : sample number $i$ 

# Regression
in linear regression , you can recognize if a problem is in regression kind if :
- you can predict the result according to input
- you have continuous value
# hypothesis function
an imaginary function which is our target function . we cannot reach it in reality but we can achieve a good estimation of it .
### $$h(x) \to  y$$
the simplest function in math is a linear function (which has a degree of n and n is ***not*** 0) .
so the simplest hypothesis function  is :
### $$h _ {\theta}(x) \to \theta _ 0 \ +\ \theta _ 1(x)$$
> [!IMPORTANT] No Thetas but Parameters !
> from now on , instead of thetas , we say parameters .
